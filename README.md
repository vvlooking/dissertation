## Step 1: Association between User Engagement and Probability of Ephemerality 
_**RQ 1.1** What content characteristics (i.e., a video's user engagement metrics and audio, visual, and linguistic elements) are associated with the moderation of nonsuicidal self-injury information on TikTok?_

**Description:** To determine whether user engagement metrics were associated with the probability of ephemerality of NSSI content on TikTok, a stepwise logistic regression was conducted using view count, like count, comment count, and share count as predictors of ephemerality. 

## Step 2: Compare User Engagement between Ephemeral and Non-Ephemeral Content
_**RQ 1.1** What content characteristics (i.e., a video's user engagement metrics and audio, visual, and linguistic elements) are associated with the moderation of nonsuicidal self-injury information on TikTok?_

## Step 3: Characterize Content Characteristics of Ephemeral and Non-Ephemeral Content
_**RQ 1.1** What content characteristics (i.e., a video's user engagement metrics and audio, visual, and linguistic elements) are associated with the moderation of nonsuicidal self-injury information on TikTok?_

_**RQ 1.1** What content characteristics (i.e., a video's user engagement metrics and audio, visual, and linguistic elements) are associated with the moderation of nonsuicidal self-injury information on TikTok?_

## Step 5: Association between Key Content Characteristics and Probability of Ephemerality while Factoring in User Engagement _(to determine if user engagement is a confounding variable)_
_**RQ 1.1** What content characteristics (i.e., a video's user engagement metrics and audio, visual, and linguistic elements) are associated with the moderation of nonsuicidal self-injury information on TikTok?_

## Step 6: Association between Interactions of Content Characteristics and Probability of Ephemerality _(to determine if content characteristics operate independently or synergistically)_
_**RQ 1.1** What content characteristics (i.e., a video's user engagement metrics and audio, visual, and linguistic elements) are associated with the moderation of nonsuicidal self-injury information on TikTok?_

## Step 7: Association between User Profile Characteristics and Probability of Ephemerality
_**RQ 1.2.** What user profile characteristics (i.e., total number of videos, total number of likes across videos, total number of followers, total number of accounts followed, and verification status) are associated with the moderation of nonsuicidal self-injury information on TikTok?_
